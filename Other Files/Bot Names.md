# MultiCube - Bot Names

---

Our Discord server has a couple of bots. The THP names are named after birds, in Latin. The MCC bots are named after trees, also in Latin. Because we are a Dutch community, we also added their Dutch names. Afer their names, we also listed their purposes. So the format is `Name: English, Dutch - Purpose`.

** Docker is a different program for hosting the bot. Such different, that is needs new files that are bot specific. Therefore, a new bot was created. Docker runs programs much more efficiently.

*** Corvus was a Linux bot. This project succeeded, and was therefore repurposed to test newer versions of the code. Not quit like Hirundo tho.
