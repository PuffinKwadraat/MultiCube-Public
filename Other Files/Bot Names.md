# MultiCube - Bot Names

----------------------------------------

Our Discord server has a couple of bots. The THP names are named after birds, in Latin. The MCC bots are named after trees, also in Latin. Because we are a Dutch community, we also added their Dutch names. Afer their names, we also listed their purposes. So the format is `Name: English, Dutch - Purpose`.

* Corvus is a special bot. Instead of a Windows pc that's hosting the bots, Corvus is kept alive by a Raspberry Pi 4. This is a Linux computer. The architecture of Windows and Linux are completely different. That's why Corvus is a special guest. It's still WIP, but someday it will be as complex as Ciconia.
