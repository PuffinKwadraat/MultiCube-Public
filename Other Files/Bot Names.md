# MultiCube - Bot Names

----------------------------------------

Our Discord server has a couple of bots. The THP names are named after birds, in Latin. The MCC bots are named after trees, also in Latin. Because we are a Dutch community, we also added their Dutch names. Afer their names, we also listed their purposes. So the format is `Name: English, Dutch - Purpose`.
