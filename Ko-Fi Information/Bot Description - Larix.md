# MultiCube - Bot Description: Larix

This is the product description of our bot: Larix.

---

## General

Larix is our Economy bot and has a build in Economy and Shop system. It connects with a Database, and you can store all the coins and data in there! Our bots are named after trees. If you look up Larix, you can find what tree it is!

## Version

From all the bots we offer, this one is the version that has the Economy and Shop system built in. If you only need for example an Admin or Level bot, please choose one of our other options that we offer.

## Contact Staff

Note that you have to contact someone from our staff for the bot to work. Since we run the bot for you, we need some information about the server. This bot has a lot of settings, that you can change depending on your environment/needings. Examples of this: command cooldowns, messages, colors etc.

## Active Development

Each bot is in active development, so the amount of features and commands will grow. Even after your purchase, you will receive updates and bug fixes. Because of this, the bot might be down sometimes. But, we are working as fast as we can to get it up and running again. Also, note that you can buy a commission for your bot. You will receive a custom requested bot command. If you don't like this idea, you can choose while configurating the bot to not have updates anymore, or just bug fixes. It's up to you!
