# MultiCube - Bot Description: Catalpa

This is the product description of our bot: Morus.

---

## General

Morus is a Music bot that works via YouTube links. You can join a call, invite your friends over, fill the queue with songs and listen to some good music. Note that the music quality depends on what level your server is (boosts). Our bots are named after trees. If you look up Morus, you can find what tree it is!

## Version

From all the bots we offer, this one is Music variant. If you only need for example an Admin or Economy bot, please choose one of our other options that we offer.

## Contact Staff

Note that you have to contact someone from our staff for the bot to work. Since we run the bot for you, we need some information about the server. This bot has a lot of settings, that you can change depending on your environment/needings. Examples of this: command cooldowns, messages, colors etc.

## Active Development

Each bot is in active development, so the amount of features and commands will grow. Even after your purchase, you will receive updates and bug fixes. Because of this, the bot might be down sometimes. But, we are working as fast as we can to get it up and running again. If you don't like this idea, you can choose while configurating the bot to not have updates anymore, or just bug fixes. It's up to you!
