# MultiCube - Bot Description: Betula

This is the product description of our bot: Betula.

---

## General

We use Betula for testing out new commands. We develop new commands, and than take it to our other bots. The benefit of this bot is that you can use new commands before others! But note that these commands are not ready yet, and don't always work. If we aren't making a new command, this bot only has 3 commands. You can read it down below. If you buy this bot, you will also get a new Discord role. Our bots are named after trees. If you look up Betula, you can find what tree it is!

## Version

From all the bots we offer, this one is the version that's for testing. So be aware that this bot isn't for everyone. If you only need for example an Admin or Economy bot, please choose one of our other options that we offer.

## Contact Staff

Note that you have to contact someone with the Discord Developer role for the bot to work. Since we run the bot for you, we need some information about the server. This bot has a lot of settings, that you can change depending on your environment/needings. Examples of this: command cooldowns, messages, colors etc.

## Active Development

Each bot is in active development, so the amount of features and commands will grow. Even after your purchase, you will receive updates and bug fixes. Because of this, the bot might be down sometimes. But, we are working as fast as we can to get it up and running again. If you don't like this idea, you can choose while configurating the bot to not have updates anymore, or just bug fixes. It's up to you!

## Commands when not in active development

Ping, just pings the bot and the bot will reply with Ping or Pong. For troubleshooting.
CmdTemp, a template for Bot Developers so that we can create a new command more easily.
EmbedTemp, like CmdTemp, but with an embed.
