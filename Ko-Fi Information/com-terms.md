# MultiCube - Commission Terms

This paragraph gives you information about our terms for commissions.

---

Depending on how large your request is, our goal is to finish projects within 1 to 2 weeks. We will keep you up to date with updates. We will reach out to your stated communication type, e-mail or Discord. For some things, like commands, a config is needed. We will contact you when your commissions is ready, and we will make an appointment when we will do the setup. Otherwise, we will just add it to your bot without extra config.

Like stated in the Instructions, if we don't like the idea, or if we aren't able to complete the commissions, we will contact you. We can talk about a solution.

Furthermore, if you are not happy with the result, we will try to fix it. If even then you don't like it, you will get a refund.
