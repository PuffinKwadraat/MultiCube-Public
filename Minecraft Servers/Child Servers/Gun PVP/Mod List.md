# Gun PVP - Mod List

-----------------------------
Here's a list of mods you have to download to join our server: `Gun PVP`

- [CGM](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mrcrayfishs-gun-mod)
   - The primary gun mod, which adds 9 new balanced and customizable weapons. Needs Obfuscate to work.

- [Obfuscate](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/obfuscate)
   - Like mentioned above, this mod supports CGM. Like Flamboyant, CGM wouldn't work without Obfuscate and is a dependency mod.
  
- [WorldEdit](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/worldedit)
   - This mod doesn't bring new content to the server. It is just a very good tool for building the maps. It can only be used by Operators.
