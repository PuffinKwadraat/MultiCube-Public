# MultiCube - How to Install Mods with Forge

Some of our servers have mods to bring new and exciting content. If you go to the folder Child Servers and then to the server you'd like you can visit the mod list there. So
every server has it own mod list. After this introduction line, you will find a step by step guide of how to install mods so you can join our servers. 

--------------------------------

### Step 1. Installing Forge
Forge supports mods, so to have mods, you first want to [download](http://files.minecraftforge.net/) Forge. Select the version needed for the server. We update everytime a new 
Minecraft release is added, so you probably need the newest version of Forge. Just click on 'Installer' (Box icon) and it should be downloading. When it's downloaded, you can
execute the .jar file. Make sure that you have played on that version atleast one time, so Forge can find the directories of that version. When Forge is installing, it searches
to the Vanilla version, so without the directories, nothing will load. When it's done installing you now have Forge installed! If you now reload you're Minecraft launcher and
select the versions, if everything went well, a new Forge icon (anvil) should appear. If that's the case, you have succesfully installed Forge, and you now have access to mods!

### Step 2. Downloading the needed Mods
Like mentioned before, go to the server you want to play on in this repository and select the mod list. Here you can find the needed mods. Click on the profided link, and you will
be redirected to the website where you can download the mods. Than, go to the 'files' tab, and select the newest file. It takes time before all the servers are up to date, so the
newest version is not always compatible. Check what version the targeted server is. Click on 'download', and it should begin. Some mods aren't frequently downloaded, so you might
get a security message. The mods we use are up to date, and do not contain virusses*. So you can hit 'allow'. Now when done, the mod should be placed in the 'Downloads' folder in
your Explorer.

### Step 3. Installing the needed Mods
To install any downloaded mods, you have to open the 'mods' folder. This folder is fairly hidden, and cannot be accessed via the normal 'Documents' folder. To go to the 'mods'
folder, open the search bar and type: Run. This is a application and can open stuff with the right command. For our destination type (or copy): %AppData%. 'AppData' is a hidden
Windows folder where some program files are stored. Press enter and you should see a list of folders. Most of the time, Minecraft is on top of the list (.minecraft). Open that
folder and now you can add stuff. If you have for example OptiFine installed, you see a 'Shaders' folder. Here you can add shaders. But we our focus is on mods, so open the 'mods'
folder. Here you can add the downloaded mods. You can open a second Explorer tab, and drag all the mods in the folder. If you are done, you can close the folder and restart your
Minecraft. On the bottom left, the number of Mods installed should be displayed. If everything is correct, you can now join the server you want. Some mods need another mod to
properly work. So if there is a message like: '2 errors occured while loading mods', and there is something said about 'requires', you want to install the needed mod. This can be
done on the same way like a normal mod. But if there aren't any errors, you should just log into Minecraft like normal. 

### Step 4. Conclusion
If everything is correct, you can now the targeted server. But do note that you can't turn on/off certain mods in game. Just follow the steps above to find the 'mods' folder.
Also, in survival or creative, the mods will be loaded. There are mods with whole new biomes (that we avoid using), so if you don't want them in your own world, just drag the mod
to another location, and restart. So before you start Minecraft, think about what you want to play: a modded server, or just Vanilla Minecraft.
