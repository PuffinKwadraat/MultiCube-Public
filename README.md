# Welcome to MultiCube Community
This GitHub repository is dedicated to our Minecraft Servers, and our own Discord Bots. All information about anything we make, can be found in this Repository.

---

### General Information
We are a group of people that make Minecraft servers and Discord bots. 

### Joining our Minecraft Servers
Most servers are just like any other public server fully joinable. But we have a couple of servers that have Mods. Like discribed above (General Information) you have to download them. If you want to know what servers have Mods, contact our support team.

### Ranks and Roles
If you want to apply for a Rank and/or Role, please fill in the [form](https://forms.gle/pabpqPiWeBp9aZ2a8). Note that for Roles like 'Builder' or 'Redstoner' aren't available for apply. These roles can be obtained by showing off you skill. If you want to be 'Redstoner', you have to be good with Redstone. If you want to be 'Builder', you have to be good with building stuff etc. If you are filling in the form, please tell us the truth. You can upload a picture of anything you have build and show us something. This isn't required, but it does help. Be aware though that we can't have 100 Admins for example, so check if the Ranks/Roles aren't full. Also, if you want the Support Role/Rank, you have to be a longtime player and know how things work. You can't get such roles if you are playing for a day or 2. Support means helping people, so you have to know how things work around our community.

### Support and Help
If you have questions about anything, you can contact our support team like said before. Check which people have the Support Role/Rank. Be polite and ask anything you'd like! If there's anything that can be done better/on another way or have suggestions, you can talk to people with Support Role. Please, be clear about what you'd like to see change, so we can get to work if we agree.

### Donate
All of our services are free. We do not get payed. Because of this, support is greatly appreciated. You can support us via Ko-Fi. You can one-time donate, or become a Supporter. Supporters will receive benefits and other exclusive cool stuff. On Ko-Fi, you can also find our temporary webshop. We will move everything when our own website is done. Here is the link to our page:

  - [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/multicubecommunity)

If you choose to support us (which we would greatly appreciate), we will get to work and pass all the benefits to you ASAP. Thank you in advance!

### Economy
Our Discord Server also has a Economy system. You can collect money through a couple ways:
  - Daily reward: as the name suggests, you can collect a DR. The command for this is `dailyreward`, it has a cooldown of 24 hours (86400 seconds).
  - Another kind off daily reward is the `search` command, and you have to pick a number.
  - Participate in events.

Furthermore, we are planning to connnect your Discord coins to your Minecraft balance, on the MultiCube server.

There are 2 types of balance:
  - Bank: you cannot pay with this, it's just an account for save keeping and saving up money.
  - Wallet: this is your direct payment method. All money earned (for example DR) goes into here.
The Economy System is not done, so this text about Economy will be expanded.

### Levels
Besides an economy system, we also have a Level system, with Levels and Experience. Each time you send a message, some Experience will be added into your profile. When you have enough Experience, you can buy a new level. We are still working on this, but the basics are there. Check the 'Commands' paragraph to see the commands associated with our Level system.
